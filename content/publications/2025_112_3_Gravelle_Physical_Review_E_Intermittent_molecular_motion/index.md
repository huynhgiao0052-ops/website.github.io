abstract: "The structure and dynamics of fluids confined in nanoporous media differ from those in bulk, which can be probed using NMR relaxation measurements. We here show, using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of water in a slit nanopore, that the behavior of the NMR relaxation rate, , with varying surface interaction and confinement strength can be estimated from the exchange statistics of fluid molecules between the adsorbed surface layer and the bulk region. In detail, we test the applicability of intermittent molecular water dynamics, a theoretical framework that relates NMR relaxation to the statistics of molecular exchange between these two states. We confront this framework with the direct evaluation of dipolar NMR relaxation rates from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of water confined in a slit nanopore, allowing to assess its accuracy across varying surface interactions. We employ first return …"
